# ProdigyInfotech_DS_Task-03


TASK 3: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

During this experience, I had the opportunity to analyze and interpret data about the bar chart and histogram, it is a graphical representation of the distribution of data points in a dataset.
